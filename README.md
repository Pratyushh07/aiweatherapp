# 🌤️ AI Weather App

**AI Weather App** is a smart and responsive weather application that combines real-time weather data with an AI-powered assistant. Built using **Python (Flask)** for the backend and **HTML/CSS** for the frontend, the app fetches weather information through the **OpenWeatherMap API** and uses **OpenAI's GPT model** to provide conversational responses about the weather.

This project demonstrates how to combine third-party APIs with AI capabilities to create interactive and user-friendly web applications.
